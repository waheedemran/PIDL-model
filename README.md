# PIDL model
Python implementation and benchmark data for a velocity-only physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) model to traffic state estimation. Includes METANET-based simulation scenario (Eulerian fixed detectors and Lagrangian probe trajectories), training scripts, and evaluation utilities to reproduce the reported results and figures of the paper.
